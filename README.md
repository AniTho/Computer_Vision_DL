Learning Computer Vision Techniques using deep learning in 2023

__Day 001 Progress:__ Learnt about Artificial Neural Network(ANN) and built a simple ANN using pytorch and trained it on Fashion MNIST Dataset

__Day 002 Progress:__ Learnt about hyperaparameter tuning in ANN and tried some of those approaches. Some of the approach is left to take care of overfitting.

__Day 003 Progress:__ Learnt about how to take care of overfitting via techniques such as dropout, L1 and L2 regularization. Also made the network a bit deeper without overfitting to the data. Finally put all the hyperparameters and techniques tried in Day_02 notebook and created final model.

__Day 004 Progress:__ Learnt about Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and its components. Also updated Day_03 notebook to save model weights. In Day_04 notebooks ran some experiment why ANN is not useful for images and implemented a very basic convolutional operation block and pooling block.
