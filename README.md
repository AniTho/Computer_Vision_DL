Learning Computer Vision Techniques using deep learning in 2023

__Day 001 Progress:__ Learnt about Artificial Neural Network(ANN) and built a simple ANN using pytorch and trained it on Fashion MNIST Dataset

__Day 002 Progress:__ Learnt about hyperaparameter tuning in ANN and tried some of those approaches. Some of the approach is left to take care of overfitting.

__Day 003 Progress:__ Learnt about how to take care of overfitting via techniques such as dropout, L1 and L2 regularization. Also made the network a bit deeper without overfitting to the data. Finally put all the hyperparameters and techniques tried in Day_02 notebook and created final model.

__Day 004 Progress:__ Learnt about Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and its components. Also updated Day_03 notebook to save model weights. In Day_04 notebooks ran some experiment why ANN is not useful for images and implemented a very basic convolutional operation block and pooling block.

__Day 005 Progress:__ Studied LeNet architecture and implemented it using pytorch (with some modification) and trained it on Fashion MNIST dataset. Also learnt about data augmentation and started to implement some of the functions and their visualization using kornia library.

__Day 006 Progress:__ Trained final convolution neural network (inspired from LeNet) on fashion MNIST dataset with augmentation and shown the affect of translation on final trained model.

__Day 007 Progress:__ Optimized the data loader, since it is the part where most time is consumed and also emperically shown result of the comparison. Trained a VGG Net model using transfer learning. Also implemented mixed precision version of the training.

__Day 008 Progress:__ Used Resnet using timm library, also replaced Kornia augmentations with albumentation augmentations. Tried different weight initialization techniques.

__DAY 009 Progress:__ Started to work on the project to find age and gender of a person from image.
