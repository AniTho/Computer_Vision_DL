Learning Computer Vision Techniques using deep learning in 2023

Day 001 Progress: Learnt about Artificial Neural Network(ANN) and built a simple ANN using pytorch and trained it on Fashion MNIST Dataset

Day 002 Progress: Learnt about hyperaparameter tuning in ANN and tried some of those approaches. Some of the approach is left to take care of overfitting.
